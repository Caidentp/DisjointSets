# DisjointSets
A Python implementation of a Disjoint Sets or Union Find data structure, made for personal use in competitive programming.

It provides essentially constant time operations on all functions, since time complexity is bounded by the Ackermann function.

This is due to the implementation of both union by rank and path compression inside the union and find functions respectively.
